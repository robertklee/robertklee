### Welcome to my GitHub! 😁

👋 I am an award-winning and ambitious 4th year **electrical/computer engineering** student passionate about:
- **machine learning (specifically computer vision problems)**
- **software engineering**
- **firmware engineering and embedded systems**

#### 💼 Workplace: Incoming Microsoft Software Engineer.

#### 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on:
- building and hosting my own personal website (check it out [here](https://www.robertkl.com)!)
- leading a team to design a deep neural network for human pose estimation (labelling 
- creating a computer vision project for 3D bounding box for autonomous vehicle applications

#### ✅ Some of my most exciting projects include:
- **Road Segmentation Machine Learning Project on KITTI ROAD dataset**:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation of road surfaces within a driving context.

- **Embedded C Optimization Project with Discrete Cosine Transform algorithm**:
Implementation of DCT algorithm in C and performance optimization using more efficient software algorithms, software-level optimizations, and hypothetical firmware- and hardware-based optimizations.

- **Computer Vision Project on Monocular Depth Estimation**:
A CNN for depth estimation on DrivingStereo dataset using Keras & Python.
