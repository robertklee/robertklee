### Hi there 👋

👋 I am an award-winning and ambitious 4th year **electrical/computer engineering** student interested in:
- **machine learning (specifically computer vision for autonomous vehicles)**
- **firmware engineering and embedded systems**
- **software engineering**

💼 I'm currently working at **Microsoft** as a Software Engineer Intern.

#### 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on:
- building and hosting my own personal website (check it out [here](www.robertkl.com)!)
- creating a computer vision project for 3D bounding box for autonomous vehicle applications

#### ✅ Some of my most exciting projects include:
- **Road Segmentation Machine Learning Project on KITTI ROAD dataset**:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation of road surfaces within a driving context.

- **Embedded C Optimization Project with Discrete Cosine Transform algorithm**:
Implementation of DCT algorithm in C and performance optimization using more efficient software algorithms, software-level optimizations, and hypothetical firmware- and hardware-based optimizations.

- **Computer Vision Project on Monocular Depth Estimation**:
A CNN for depth estimation on DrivingStereo dataset using Keras & Python.

- **Networked Game Application: Royal Game of Ur**:
A multi-user two-player online game implemented using Python, Bottle, React, and SQLite & server-side logic.

- **Battlesnake Reinforcement Learning AI Design**:
Challenge: Classic snake game mechanics, but with up to 7 opponent snakes. Collisions with longer snakes or starvation result in death. Design algorithm to control snake in real-time game. Goal: Survive the longest.
