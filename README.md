### Welcome to my GitHub!

üëã I am an award-winning and ambitious B.Eng. in **electrical/computer engineering** passionate about:
- **machine learning (specifically computer vision problems)**
- **software engineering**
- **firmware engineering and embedded systems**

#### üíº Workplace: Senior Software Engineer @ Microsoft.
I‚Äôm an award-winning software engineer with a B.Eng with distinction in computer engineering, specializing in machine learning and software engineering. Currently, I‚Äôm working at Microsoft at the intersection of information retrieval, vector search, and search relevance, harnessing the power of large language models to deliver AI-empowered enterprise search relevance and Retrieval Augmented Generation chat completion scenarios.

#### üë®‚Äçüíª I'm currently working on:
- building and hosting my own personal website (check it out [here](https://www.robertkl.com)!)
- creating a computer vision project for 3D bounding box for autonomous vehicle applications

#### ‚úÖ Some of my most exciting projects include:
- **Human Pose Estimation on COCO 2017 Dataset**:
I led a team to design and train a deep neural network for human pose estimation (labelling various joint locations). Using a modified stacked hourglass network and a newly implemented data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline, we achieved results comparable with state-of-the-art from late 2017, in less than three months of work.

- **Road Segmentation Machine Learning Project on KITTI ROAD dataset**:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation of road surfaces within a driving context.

- **Embedded C Optimization Project with Discrete Cosine Transform algorithm**:
Implementation of DCT algorithm in C and optimizing performance using more efficient software algorithms, software-level optimizations, and hypothetical firmware- and hardware-based optimizations.

- **Computer Vision Project on Monocular Depth Estimation**:
A CNN for depth estimation on DrivingStereo dataset using Keras & Python.
